I am a fisheries scientist and programmer currently based at the [Fish Ecology and Conservation Physiology Laboratory](https://www.fecpl.ca/), Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, CA. This blog is an extension of my website and is where I host vignettes on a wide range of topics mostly focused on data applications for aquatic scientist. If you're looking for data applications related to human-dimensions and sport related science please check out my brother, [Matthew Hlina's](https://matthewhlina.github.io/website/), website.
