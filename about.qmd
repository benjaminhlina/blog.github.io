I am a fisheries scientist and programmer currently based at the [Fish Ecology and Conservation Physiology Laboratory](https://www.fecpl.ca/), Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, CA. This blog is an extension of my website and is where I host vignettes on a wide range of topics mostly focused on data applications for aquatic scientist.
